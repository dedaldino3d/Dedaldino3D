# Hi, I'm Dedaldino António 👋

I build **complex financial systems** that just work. From handling payments, credit reporting, and compliance to designing full-stack apps for real users, I focus on **solving problems that matter**.  

I like projects where the stakes are high, the rules are strict, and failure is not an option — but I also care about making things usable and maintainable.  

---

## What I Build

- **End-to-end FinTech platforms** — APIs, frontends, and infrastructure.  
- **Payments and credit systems** — Stripe migrations, credit reporting, cross-border flows.  
- **AI-assisted personal finance tools** — insights, projections, and dashboards for real people.  
- **High-availability infrastructure** — deployments you can trust, monitoring you can rely on.

## Proof Through Impact

### 1. The "Enterprise" Proof: Jetty (US FinTech)
I led development on a credit-building platform integrated *directly* with **Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion.** I also engineered a high-stakes migration of a legacy **Stripe v2** payments system, ensuring 100% uptime and **SOC2** data security.

### 2. The "Founder" Proof: Tumaio (My Startup)
I am currently the solo founder of Tumaio, an AI-powered PFM for emerging markets. I am architecting the entire platform (Node.js/Fastify, Next.js) and proving my daily discipline with an **800+ contribution / 87-day** GitHub streak.

### 3. The "Architect" Proof: Corpotal (Built for Railbus)
I was recruited by Railbus (Dubai) to **solely architect and build "Corpotal,"** their mission-critical shareholder management platform. I owned the entire full-stack (Python/Django, React) and AWS infrastructure, delivering a secure product from a blank page.

## How I Work

I approach problems like this:  

1. Understand the **real user need** or business constraint.  
2. Design a **simple, reliable solution**, even if the underlying system is complex.  
3. Ship it **iteratively**, learning and improving along the way.  

I care more about **making the system actually work** than about buzzwords, hype, or “best practices” that don’t fit the context.

## The Tools I Use

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|-----|
| Backend & API | Node.js (Fastify/Express), Python (Django/Flask), PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB |
| Frontend | React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Typescript |
| Payments & Compliance | Stripe (v2→v3), credit reporting APIs, SOC2 readiness |
| Infrastructure | AWS, Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, Nginx |

## Why This Matters

If you’re hiring for **senior software, fullstack, backend, or payments roles**, you’re not just getting a developer — you’re getting someone who can:  

- Design and ship **end-to-end systems from scratch**  
- Solve **high-stakes financial and compliance challenges**  
- Deliver **impact quickly**, independently or in a team
